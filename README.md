# Tome-Rater

### Introduction
In this capstone, you will create an application called TomeRater that
allows users to read and rate books.
The purpose of this capstone is to practice implementing and testing
classes in Python. You will be given specifications for methods for 5
different classes that interact with each other. To create these methods you
will use your knowledge of lists, loops, dictionaries, strings, control flow,
and of course, basic Python syntax! If you need to refresh your memory of
these concepts, go back to these lessons in the syllabus.
Compared to the other projects you have completed this far, we are
requiring few restrictions on how you structure your code. In addition,
much of the code you write for later parts of this project will depend on
how you decided to implement earlier parts.
